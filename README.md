# Physics Simulation Exploration

Collision handling:
- Momentum impulse w/ Spring Force Model (currently implemented)
- Solution for 2D Elastic collision (in progress)

Current progress:
- Look at `TestCanvas.java` in the `test` folder and run it to view a simulation (four balls are currently loaded).
