# Physics Simulation Exploration

Collision handling:
- Naive distance checking
- Grid check (in progress)

Motion:
- Momentum impulse w/ Spring Force Model (currently implemented)
  - Change the spring force constant `K` (Hooke's Law) in `Circle.java` if you wish to change the force on collision impact.
- Solution for 2D Elastic collision (in progress)

Current progress:
- Look at `TestCanvas.java` in the `test` folder and run it to view a simulation (four balls are currently loaded).
